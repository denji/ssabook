This type of profiling subsumes the more common basic block and edge profiling, which only approximate path frequencies. Path profiles have many potential uses in program performance tuning, profile-directed compilation, and software test coverage.\par This paper describes a new algorithm for path profiling. This simple, fast algorithm selects and places profile instrumentation to minimize run-time overhead. Instrumented programs run with overhead comparable to the best previous profiling techniques. On the SPEC95 benchmarks, path profiling overhead averaged 31 edge profiling. Path profiling also identifies longer paths than a previous technique, which predicted paths from edge profiles (average of 88, versus 34 instructions). Moreover, profiling shows that the SPEC95 train input datasets covered most of the paths executed in the ref datasets.",

	abstract = "In this thesis we address the problem of optimal code generation for irregular architectures such as Digital Signal Processors (DSPs).Code generation consists mainly of three interrelated optimization tasks: instruction selection (with resource allocation), instruction scheduling and register allocation. These tasks have been discovered to be NP-hard for most architectures and most situations. A common approach to code generation consists in solving each task separately, i.e. in a decoupled manner, which is easier from a software engineering point of view. Phase-decoupled compilers produce good code quality for regular architectures, but if applied to DSPs the resulting code is of significantly lower performance due to strong interdependences between the different tasks.We developed a novel method for fully integrated code generation at the basic block level, based on dynamic programming. It handles the most important tasks of code generation in a single optimization step and produces an optimal code sequence. Our dynamic programming algorithm is applicable to small, yet not trivial problem instances with up to 50 instructions per basic block if data locality is not an issue, and up to 20 instructions if we take data locality with optimal scheduling of data transfers on irregular processor architectures into account. For larger problem instances we have developed heuristic relaxations.In order to obtain a retargetable framework we developed a structured architecture specification language, xADML, which is based on XML. We implemented such a framework, called OPTIMIST that is parameterized by an xADML architecture specification.The thesis further provides an Integer Linear Programming formulation of fully integrated optimal code generation for VLIW architectures with a homogeneous register file. Where it terminates successfully, the ILP-based optimizer mostly works faster than the dynamic programming approach; on the other hand, it fails for several larger examples where dynamic programming still provides a solution. Hence, the two approaches complement each other. In particular, we show how the dynamic programming approach can be used to precondition the ILP formulation.As far as we know from the literature, this is for the first time that the main tasks of code generation are solved optimally in a single and fully integrated optimization step that additionally considers data placement in register sets and optimal scheduling of data transfers between different registers sets.",

	abstract = "Instruction scheduling and register allocation are two very important optimizations in modern compilers for advanced processors. These two optimizations must be performed simultaneously in order to maximize the instruction-level parallelism and to fully utilize the registers [11]. In this paper we solve register allocation and instruction scheduling simultaneously using integer linear programming (ILP). We have successfully worked out the ILP formulations for the problem with and without register spilling. Two kinds of optimizations are considered: (1) Fix the number of free registers and then solve for the minimum number of cycles to execute the instructions, or (2) fix the maximum execution cycles for the instructions and solve for the minimum number of registers needed. Besides being theoretically interesting, our solution serves as a reference point for other heuristic solutions. The formulations are also applicable to high-level synthesis of ASICs and designs for embedde...",

A model with fewer such points can be solved faster. The paper presents ways to eliminate most of the redundant points, and evaluates them on the SPEC CPU92 and SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks. It also reevaluates the old model on current hardware with a current ILP solver, and compares the three sets of results, showing that all three components (hardware, the better ILP solver, and the improved model) contribute 1-2 orders of magnitude of speedup. The new optimal register allocator can optimally allocate 98\ CPU2000 benchmarks and find a near-optimal result for another 1\ reduction on HP-PA of 5.3\ colouring register allocator. The boundary between solved and unsolved is for function sizes in the range 90-2000 instruction.",

We present a novel register allocation architecture for programs in SSA-form which simplifies register allocation significantly. We investigate certain properties of SSA-programs and their interference graphs, showing that they belong to the class of chordal graphs. This leads to a quadratic-time optimal coloring algorithm and allows for decoupling the tasks of coloring, spilling and coalescing completely. After presenting heuristic methods for spilling and coalescing, we compare our coalescing heuristic to an optimal method based on integer linear programming.},

A class of formal machine descriptions is introduced, capable of describing a wide range of irregular architectures. We extend Chaitin's register allocation algorithm to handle any architectural constraints that can be expressed using these machine descriptions. The generalized algorithm is applicable to a wider range of architectures and systems than any other adaptation of Chaitin's algorithm found in the literature. We argue that the modifications to the original algorithm can be combined with most important extensions to Chaitin's framework, for example coalescing and optimistic coloring.",

	abstract = {This thesis studies the problem of reducing code size produced by an optimizing compiler. We develop the Value State Dependence Graph (VSDG) as a powerful intermediate form. Nodes represent computation, and edges represent value (data) and state (control) dependencies between nodes. The edges specify a partial ordering of the nodes---sufficient ordering to maintain the I/O semantics of the source program, while allowing optimizers greater freedom to move nodes within the program to achieve better (smaller) code. Optimizations, both classical and new, transform the graph through graph rewriting rules prior to code generation. Additional (semantically inessential) state edges are added to transform the VSDG into a Control Flow Graph, from which target code is generated. We show how procedural abstraction can be advantageously applied to the VSDG. Graph patterns are extracted from a program's VSDG. We then select repeated patterns giving the greatest size reduction, generate new functions from these patterns, and replace all occurrences of the patterns in the original VSDG with calls to these abstracted functions. Several embedded processors have load- and store-multiple instructions, representing several loads (or stores) as one instruction. We present a method, benefiting from the VSDG form, for using these instructions to reduce code size by provisionally combining loads and stores before code generation. The final contribution of this thesis is a combined register allocation and code motion (RACM) algorithm. We show that our RACM algorithm formulates these two previously antagonistic phases as one combined pass over the VSDG, transforming the graph (moving or cloning nodes, or spilling edges) to fit within the physical resources of the target processor. We have implemented our ideas within a prototype C compiler and suite of VSDG optimizers, generating code for the Thumb 32-bit processor. Our results show improvements for each optimization and that we can achieve code sizes comparable to, and in some cases better than, that produced by commercial compilers with significant investments in optimization technology.},

	abstract = {Most modern compilers are based on variants of the Control Flow Graph. Developments on this representation---specifically, SSA form and the Program Dependence Graph (PDG)---have focused on adding and refining data dependence information, and these suggest the next step is to use a purely data-dependence-based representation such as the VDG (Ernst et al.) or VSDG (Johnson et al.). This thesis studies such representations, identifying key differences in the information carried by the VSDG and several restricted forms of PDG, which relate to functional programming and continuations. We unify these representations in a new framework for specifying the sharing of resources across a computation. We study the problems posed by using the VSDG, and argue that existing techniques have not solved the sequentialization problem of mapping VSDGs back to CFGs. We propose a new compiler architecture breaking sequentialization into several stages which focus on different characteristics of the input VSDG, and tend to be concerned with different properties of the output and target machine. The stages integrate a wide variety of important optimizations, exploit opportunities offered by the VSDG to address many common phase-order problems, and unify many operations previously considered distinct. Focusing on branch-intensive code, we demonstrate how effective control flow---sometimes superior to that of the original source code, and comparable to the best CFG optimization techniques---can be reconstructed from just the dataflow information comprising the VSDG. Further, a wide variety of more invasive optimizations involving the duplication and specialization of program elements are eased because the VSDG relaxes the CFG's overspecification of instruction and branch ordering. Specifically we identify the optimization of nested branches as generalizing the problem of minimizing boolean expressions. We conclude that it is now practical to discard the control flow information rather than maintain it in parallel as is done in many previous approaches (e.g. the PDG).},
