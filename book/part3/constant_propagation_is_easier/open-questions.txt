open questions:

% FERNANDO: this is not clear to me: I think these sets are no longer necessary
% because you can bind their info directly to the variables that they represent.
% They would not be necessary even in a straight line program without phis.

i don't get the comment. the sentence that this comment refers to already says
that the in/out sets are obsolete. it seems the comment is just repeating the
same thing?!?

% FERNANDO: There is a lot of redundancy between this section and the
% equivalent section in Chapter \ref{chap:ssi}. I guess some refactoring can
% be used to make the final text less repetitive.

yup. i mentioned several times to fabrice that i think that there is a lot of
redundancy. i proposed to merge some chapters (long long ago, there was talk of
a chapter on dead-code eliminate, the ssi chapter, and, if i remember correctly,
something on bit-width analysis). also the computation of liveness sets is
somewhat related. i am not open to any fundamental changes anymore. i want to
get this chapter done.
