\section{benefits of SSA}

\section{properties: suffixed representation can use dense vector, vs DF needs (x,PP) needs hashtable}
\section{phi node construction precomputes DF merge}
\section{dominance properties imply that simple forward analysis works}
\section{Flow insensitive somewhat improved by SSA}
\section{building defuse chains: for each SSA variable can get pointer to next var}
\section{improves SSA DF-propagation}
