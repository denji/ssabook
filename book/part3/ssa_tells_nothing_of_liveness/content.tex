\section{SSA tells nothing about liveness}

Starts with a counter example of the intuition that live-range is ``between'' the definition and the uses.

\section{Computing liveness sets}
Provides Appel's (In the modern compiler book) technique to compute liveness sets under SSA.

\section{Liveness check}
