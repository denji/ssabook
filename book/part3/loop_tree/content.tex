The SSA representation captures more than the scalar computations: the
phi nodes and the scalar assignments encode the structure of the CFG
and the strongly connected components of the CFG that are the natural
loops.  This chapter will present two analysis algorithms: the
extraction of the natural loop tree and the analysis of induction
variables based on the SSA representation.
