\section{Overview}

\textbf{0.5 page}

Explain what SSI means when applied to predicated code: different names for uses under different predicates, instead of different control flow paths.

\section{Definition}

\textbf{0.5 page}

Introduce a SIGMA operation that works on predicates instead of control-flow edges. Explain the similarities and differences with the PSI projection.

\section{Constant propagation}

\textbf{0.5 page}

Explain how constant propagation works on PSI-SSI, which is very similar to PSI projection.

\section{Predicate sensitive live-analysis and interference graph}

\textbf{1 page}

Explain how predicate sensitive live-analysis can be performed under PSI-SSI, and show the improvement on the coalescing phase for the out-of-SSA algorithm.
