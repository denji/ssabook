In this section, we
use Array SSA form to develop
a simple, unified approach for the analysis and
optimization of 
object field and array element accesses in strongly typed languages, 
that works in the presence of
object references (pointers).
We show how SSA-based program
analyses developed for scalars and arrays can be extended to
operate on object references in a strongly typed language like Java.
This extension models object references as
indices into hypothetical {\em heap arrays}.
We then describe a {\em redundant load} analysis
that uses Array SSA form on heap arrays, and a {\em scalar replacement}
that uses the results of the analysis to replace operations on object fields
and array elements by operations on scalar
variables.
