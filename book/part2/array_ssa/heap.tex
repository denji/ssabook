In this section, we present a simple, unified approach for the analysis and
optimization of 
object field and array element accesses in strongly typed languages, 
that works in the presence of
object references/pointers, using an extension of Array SSA form to handle both array element and object field accesses 
uniformly.
We show how SSA-based program
analyses developed for scalars and arrays can be extended to
operate on object references in a strongly typed language like Java.
This extension models object references as
indices into hypothetical {\em heap arrays}.
We then present two new sparse analysis
algorithms using
the heap array representation; one identifies redundant loads, and the
other identifies dead stores.
Using strong typing to help disambiguation, these algorithms are
more efficient than equivalent analyses for weakly typed languages.
Using the results of these algorithms, we can perform scalar replacement
transformations to change operations on object fields
and array elements into operations on scalar
variables.  We present preliminary experimental results to illustrate the benefits obtained by
performing redundant load and dead store elimination on Java
programs.
