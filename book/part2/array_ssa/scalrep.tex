% In this section, we introduce two new analyses based on Extended
% Array SSA form.  These two analyses form the backbone of 
% {\em scalar replacement} transformations, which replace accesses
% to memory by uses of scalar temporaries.  First, we present an
% analysis to identify fully redundant loads.  Then, we present an
% analysis to identify dead stores.

% Figure~\ref{fig:ex2} illustrates two different cases of scalar
% replacement for object fields. 
% For the original program in figure~\ref{fig:ex2}(a),
% introducing a scalar temporary {\tt T1} for the store (def) of {\tt
% p.x} can enable the load (use) of {\tt p.x} to be eliminated \ie\ to
% be replaced by a use of {\tt T1}.  Figure~\ref{fig:ex2}(b)
% contains an example in which a scalar temporary ({\tt T2}) is
% introduced for the first load of {\tt p.x}, thus enabling the second
% load of {\tt p.x} to be eliminated \ie\ replaced by {\tt T2}.  
% Finally,
% figure~\ref{fig:ex2}(c) contains an example in which the first store of {\tt
% p.x} can be eliminated because it is known to be dead (redundant); no
% scalar temporary needs to be introduced in this case.
