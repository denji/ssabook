\section{Overview}

\textbf{0.5 pages}

Simple explanation of the differences between 
SSA and SSI. Motivate the reasons for SSI's extensions
over SSA.

%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Definition}

\textbf{2 pages}

Give the semantics of $\sigma$-functions, show how these
are dual to $\phi$-functions. Explain SSI in terms
of dominance and post-dominance relations in the control
flow graph.

%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Construction}

\textbf{3 pages}

Algorithms for constructing SSI. Probably mention
Ananian's algorithm in passing, then focus on 
iterated dominance frontier algorithm for construction.
Have a walk-through example.

%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Applications}

\textbf{2 pages}

Very brief discussion of potential analyses
that could benefit from SSI.

\section{Experience Report}

\textbf{0.5 pages}

Possibly get material from STMicroelectronics, since they
have implemented SSI construction and analysis in some
of their compiler systems. Mixed feedback - incorporate
all this here.
