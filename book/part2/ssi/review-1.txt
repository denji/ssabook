I like the chapter as it is (even if the annotated pdf it contains lots of red...).
The main remarks are the following:
- remove all the none self references and keep it for a last section that is missing. This last section should contain references, open problems, discussions, etc.
- some stuffs that are redundant with the prop. engine chapter can be removed
- I have concerns with some notations
- one running example is to my point of view not well chosen
- slightly different formalism to describe the way of computing the set of split points
- a discussion on the usefulnes of sigma
- develop a little bit more the usefulness of pruning and how to avoid the insertion of useful sigma (pDF+ not in the live-range)
- discuss why and when all split points are not necessary (for non "dense" problems)
