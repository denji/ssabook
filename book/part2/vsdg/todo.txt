Notes from Fabrice:
      - We do not see the difference between SSA graph and SSA (where use-def chains are implicit)
      - I want the hardware chapter to use the same GSA. Do not mind which one
      - A concrete example is missing to illustrate GSA usefulness vs. SSA + CFG.
      - I do not understand why mu does not contain the predicate as an argument. The handling of loops should be explained.
      - Expansion of GSA section (help from Pedro?)
      - Motivating examples and comparisons between described solutions.
