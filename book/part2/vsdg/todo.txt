Notes from Fabrice:
      - We do not see the difference between SSA graph and SSA (where use-def chains are implicit)
      - I want the hardware chapter to use the same GSA. Do not mind which one
      - A concrete example is missing to illustrate GSA usefulness vs. SSA + CFG.
      - I do not understand why mu does not contain the predicate as an argument. The handling of loops should be explained.
      - It would be useful to have an intuition as to how gating functions are computed. In particular it is not clear whether the predicate can always be computed. If not, how is it handled?
      - Add more detail in construction algorithm for PDG.
      - Expansion of GSA section (help from Pedro?)
      - DFG explanation (which DFG does this mean?)
      - Motivating examples and comparisons between described solutions.
