 Page numbers are underlined in the index when they represent the definition or 
 the main source of information about whatever is being indexed.  A page number 
 is given in {\it italics} when that page contains an instructive example, use, 
 or discussion of the concept in question.
% It is said that ``A good, 
% professionally written index is a road map that leads both experts and novices 
% in your field to every pertinent sentence you have written.'' This is not a 
% good, professionally written index.
