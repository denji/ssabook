Directory structure:

	The content structure is of the form:
		part1/
			introduction/
				content.tex
			chapter_name1/
				content.tex
			chapter_name2/
				content.tex
		part2/
			...
		...

	This is to allow the book, each part and each chapter to be built separately
	(and therefore quickly). As a result, any modifications to book.tex will
	probably need to be made to templates/*.tex aswell.



Building:

	Simply run 'make' at the granularity of your choice:

		- In this directory, the entire book will be built, and output in book.{ps,pdf}
		- In partX/, the "part" will be built, and output in part.{ps,pdf}
		- In partX/chapter_name/, the chapter will be built, and output in chapter.{ps,pdf}
		- If you have problems, look at 'make help'.
	
	Sometimes 'make' doesn't include enough details. 'make VERBOSE=1' will
	include more (probably far too many) details.

	All chapters/parts are built using scripts/make_all.sh or
	scripts/collate.sh. The latter also moves the built sections into the
	pdfs/directory.


Latex macros:

	Macros are maintained in book/headers/macros.tex. Please don't be too fancy,
	it might all change once the publisher is found.


Latex packages:

	Macros are maintained in book/headers/packages.tex
	

Extra files:

	There are a lot of extras dotted around the place. You may ignore them.
		- GNUmakefile
			Builds the book, each part, and chapters
		- ._d/
			Dependency files from 'make' using GNUmakefile
		- part.tex/chapter.tex
			Wrapper latex files to build {chapter,part}.{ps,pdf}


Other:

	None of this is set in stone. Please suggest new or changes to standard
	practices/tools/etc on the mailing list.
