Directory structure:

	The content structure is of the form:
		part1/
			introduction/
				content.tex
			chapter_name1/
				content.tex
			chapter_name2/
				content.tex
		part2/
			...
		...

	This is to allow the book, each part and each chapter to be built separately
	(and therefore quickly). As a result, any modifications to book.tex will
	probably need to be made to templates/*.tex aswell.



Building:

	Simply run 'make' at the granularity of your choice:

		- In this directory, the entire book will be built, and output in book.{ps,pdf}
		- In partX/, the "part" will be built, and output in part.{ps,pdf}
		- In partX/chapter_name/, the chapter will be built, and output in chapter.{ps,pdf}
		- If you have problems, look at 'make help'.
	
	Sometimes 'make' doesn't include enough details. 'make VERBOSE=1' will
	include more (probably far too many) details. Alternatively, check the .log
	file.

	Sometimes 'make' can be a bit buggy. Try 'make purge' and then 'make' again,
	if you are having problems.

	All chapters/parts are built using scripts/make_all.sh or
	scripts/collate.sh. The latter also moves the built sections into the
	pdfs/directory.


Latex macros:

	Macros are maintained in book/headers/macros.tex. Please don't be too fancy,
	it might all change once the publisher is found.


Latex packages:

	Macros are maintained in book/headers/packages.tex

Bibliographies:

	Citations in content.tex should be resolved in chapter.bib. The makefile
	will automatically handle iterating over latex and bibtex for you.

	Since some chapters don't have citation commands yet, there is a
	\cite{ignore} command added automatically. This stops the build for a
	chapter from failing. Ignore the error.

	There is not yet a particular format for writing bibliographies. Use your
	own preference for now, and we'll decide on something consistent later.

	Bibliographies don't yet work for part.tex and book.tex files. This will
	obviously need to be fixed.
	

Extra files:

	There are a lot of extras dotted around the place. You may ignore them.
		- GNUmakefile
			Builds the book, each part, and chapters
		- ._d/
			Dependency files from 'make' using GNUmakefile
		- part.tex/chapter.tex
			Wrapper latex files to build {chapter,part}.{ps,pdf}


Other:

	None of this is set in stone. Please suggest new or changes to standard
	practices/tools/etc on the mailing list.
