Hyphenation (S&W):
- use an hyphen for any compound adjective (instead of space)
- don't use hyphen that can be better written as one word. If the compound is highly used in the literature then this might be a good reason to union them.

Title Case:
- Always capitalize the first and the last word. 
- Capitalize all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and
 subordinate conjunctions ("as", "because", "although").
- Lowercase all articles, coordinate conjunctions ("and", "or", "nor"),
 and prepositions regardless of length, when they are other than the
 first or last word.
- Lowercase the "to" in an infinitive.
