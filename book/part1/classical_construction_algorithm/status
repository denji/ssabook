most of the material is present.
Remains to:
I. Changes:
 - add pseudo-code for parallel copy sequentialization (see email sent by FAB): JEREMY
 - include some of the figures (in pictures) in the latex: JEREMY
 - fill up the section on "turning into conventional/pruned/dominance" (or we decided to do it in Philip's chapter?): FAB
 - check the coherance with chapter properties to remove redundancies: FAB
 - make sure all notions are introduced somewhere. Provide the reference to it: JEREMY
 - fill-up all cross-references to other chapters: JEREMY
 - remove all FIXME, remarks etc: JEREMY

Deadline?

II. Review
Cross-review: Anton Ertl?

III. Final version
List of index terms for this chapter: JEREMY, FLORENT
Final cleanup (figures / pseudo-codes / index): FLORENT

old status mailed to Jeremy:
> I have described the construction using DF+. I will add a section at the
> end describing the construction of Click. I will also add a discussion
> for making a non-minimal SSA minimal (opened problem). I will remove
> section 3 which is covered by the previous chapter of philip (even if
> Philip should not describe any algorithm). I wil just end up section 2
> by a conclusion saying which form I have constructed and refering to
> appropriate chapters if necessary. I need to add the pseudo-code for
> parallel copy sequentialization. I need to add a few examples.
