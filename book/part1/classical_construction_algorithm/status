I. Changes:

 - include some of the figures (in pictures) in the latex: JEREMY
 - fill up the section on "turning into conventional/pruned/dominance" (or we decided to do it in Philip's chapter?): FAB
 - check the coherance with chapter properties to remove redundancies: FAB
 - make sure all notions are introduced somewhere. Provide the reference to it: JEREMY
 - fill-up all cross-references to other chapters: JEREMY
 - remove all FIXME, remarks etc: JEREMY

Deadline?
