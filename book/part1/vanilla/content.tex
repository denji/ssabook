\section{motivation}

\textbf{1 page}

Discuss the utility of names as abstract identifiers.
Possibility of unique names for distinct entities.
Maybe a slightly humorous example, involving Homer Simpson and
Homer the classical Greek poet. Convey the point that,
without unique names, extra \textit{context} is required
to make the name useful.

Static single assignment form involves giving unique
names to variables at points in program text when values change.
(Expand this).

\section{informal semantics (with examples)}

\textbf{3 pages}

Given a simple pseudo-code language, show examples of programs in SSA.
(Should I show before/after SSA transformation, or just programs
in SSA form already?)

example 1. Straightline code.

example 2. if/then/else conditional. 

(Explain carefully how $\phi$-functions work.)

example 3. while loop?

\section{definition}

\textbf{1.5 pages}

Informally, static means `program text.'
single means `unique names'
assignment means `at variable definitions.'

Again, informally, unique definition for each variable.

Formally, in terms of dominance. Each var has a unique
definition, and def dominates all uses.
Perhaps require implicit defs of all vars at entry,
implicit uses of all vars at exit?

Probably need forward links to Philip's discussion of
SSA flavours and properties here.

\section{brief history}

\textbf{1.5 pages}

Crib most of this from Kenneth Zadeck. 
Talk about early developments at IBM in 1980s.
Talk about eventual emergence of SSA.
Talk about other program dependence graph
representations, perhaps a forward pointer to 
VSDG chapter.

\section{comparison with dataflow analysis (high level overview of DFA)}

\textbf{3 pages}

Very simple. Discuss lattice-based data flow analysis.
Propagating facts around control-flow points in a CFG.

Talk about SSA simplification - rename whenever data flow
facts can change (for a certain class of data flow problems?)
so, can associate facts directly with names, rather than with
name at point.
