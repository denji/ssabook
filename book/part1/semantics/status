I liked the part on functional interpretation for several reasons:
- there was examples so that I could understand
- the way loop closed are handled is novel for a classical SSA perspective (and interesting)
- the equivalence is well described so can be useful for people who want to know more about the other area. 

I was quite disapointed by 1.2 & 2. Indeed the style is too much like a "related work" section in a paper: very technical, not self-content, with lack of motivations. 

In blue are my notes, in red my comments. Please, try to put yourself in the skin of someone who knows nothing about semantics, type systems, etc: provide examples, explain without technical terms every term (I have underlined many of them).
