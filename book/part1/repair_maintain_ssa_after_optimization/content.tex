\section{Repair SSA after spill code insertion}
We present how SSA can be maintained during the optimization process. 
In some optimization passes, new definitions are added to a variable.
One prominent example is spill code insertion:
The compiler may insert multiple loads for a variable.
These loads are additional definitions for the former SSA variable.
Hence, each use has possibly to be rewired to one of the newly inserted definitions.
If uses are suddenly behind dominance frontiers, additional phi-functions need to be inserted.

We present a a fast algorithm that updates every use of a variable when new definitions of that variable are inserted.
Furthermore we discuss the algorithms by Sastry and Ju (PLDI'97) and Sarkar (CC'??) that aim for a similar purpose.
