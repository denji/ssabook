deadline: May 10
what:  add references/short explanation for loop closed form (also mentioned in Pop's chapter); add cross-reference to section 3.3.1.; check if jump-threading is not the same than the tail duplication in chapter if-convertion (if yes add cross reference); double check the TODO concerning strictness on section 5.4; proofread (spotted a bunch of grammar issues and inconsistencies); add all the missing cross-references; add as much index as possible; see the review of francois
