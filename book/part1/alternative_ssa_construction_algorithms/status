All the material is present

Start the peer reviewing process (Sebastian Hack?).
Peer reviewer may use my review.

A fast traversal of the paper shows that some more polishing might be required:
- Check the definition of J-edges
- Reconsider notations (see review): M set & additional J-edges
- Replace the summary by adding useful references
- remove some parts that are redundant (eg J(S), M(S), etc)
- Clarify Pingali, Bilardi
- Clarify just need a second pass for Ramalingam
- may require an example for Ramlingam's algorithm
