                  phases in optimizing compilers, much work has been
                  done to improve its quality and speed.  We present a
                  novel register allocation architecture for programs
                  in SSA-form which simplifies register allocation
                  significantly. We investigate certain properties of
                  SSA-programs and their interference graphs, showing
                  that they belong to the class of chordal
                  graphs. This leads to a quadratic-time optimal
                  coloring algorithm and allows for decoupling the
                  tasks of coloring, spilling and coalescing
                  completely. After presenting heuristic methods for
                  spilling and coalescing, we compare our coalescing
                  heuristic to an optimal method based on integer
                  linear programming.},

		 graph-coloring register allocation to the irregular
		 architectures used in embedded systems. A class of
		 formal machine descriptions is introduced, capable of
		 describing a wide range of irregular architectures. We
		 extend Chaitin's register allocation algorithm to
		 handle any architectural constraints that can be
		 expressed using these machine descriptions. The
		 generalized algorithm is applicable to a wider range of
		 architectures and systems than any other adaptation of
		 Chaitin's algorithm found in the literature. We argue
		 that the modifications to the original algorithm can be
		 combined with most important extensions to Chaitin's
		 framework, for example coalescing and optimistic
		 coloring.",

		 Processors",
  author =	"Andrzej Bednarski",
  year = 	"2006",
  month =	jun # "~09",
  abstract =	"In this thesis we address the problem of optimal code
		 generation for irregular architectures such as Digital
		 Signal Processors (DSPs).Code generation consists
		 mainly of three interrelated optimization tasks:
		 instruction selection (with resource allocation),
		 instruction scheduling and register allocation. These
		 tasks have been discovered to be NP-hard for most
		 architectures and most situations. A common approach to
		 code generation consists in solving each task
		 separately, i.e. in a decoupled manner, which is easier
		 from a software engineering point of view.
		 Phase-decoupled compilers produce good code quality for
		 regular architectures, but if applied to DSPs the
		 resulting code is of significantly lower performance
		 due to strong interdependences between the different
		 tasks.We developed a novel method for fully integrated
		 code generation at the basic block level, based on
		 dynamic programming. It handles the most important
		 tasks of code generation in a single optimization step
		 and produces an optimal code sequence. Our dynamic
		 programming algorithm is applicable to small, yet not
		 trivial problem instances with up to 50 instructions
		 per basic block if data locality is not an issue, and
		 up to 20 instructions if we take data locality with
		 optimal scheduling of data transfers on irregular
		 processor architectures into account. For larger
		 problem instances we have developed heuristic
		 relaxations.In order to obtain a retargetable framework
		 we developed a structured architecture specification
		 language, xADML, which is based on XML. We implemented
		 such a framework, called OPTIMIST that is parameterized
		 by an xADML architecture specification.The thesis
		 further provides an Integer Linear Programming
		 formulation of fully integrated optimal code generation
		 for VLIW architectures with a homogeneous register
		 file. Where it terminates successfully, the ILP-based
		 optimizer mostly works faster than the dynamic
		 programming approach; on the other hand, it fails for
		 several larger examples where dynamic programming still
		 provides a solution. Hence, the two approaches
		 complement each other. In particular, we show how the
		 dynamic programming approach can be used to
		 precondition the ILP formulation.As far as we know from
		 the literature, this is for the first time that the
		 main tasks of code generation are solved optimally in a
		 single and fully integrated optimization step that
		 additionally considers data placement in register sets
		 and optimal scheduling of data transfers between
		 different registers sets.",

		 for the minimum number of registers needed. Besides
