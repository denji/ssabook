One of the applications of data-flow analysis is the translation of
sequential code into parallel code.  This translation is usually
performed by compilers to adapt the program to the target machine
hardware: vector instructions, multi or single processors.  This
chapter presents some translation algorithms that start from the SSA
representation and target parallel, vector and sequential code.
