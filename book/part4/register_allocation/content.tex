We will start be giving an overview and intuitive understanding why SSA helps register allocation.
Then, we present the principal architecure of an SSA-based register allocator.

We discuss spilling, assignment, and coalescing in further detail and review the proposed techniques.
Finally, we present the corresponding complexity results for each phase.
