%%
%%   The goal of this package is to provide a mechanism by which you
%%  one can check that two sequences of text or figures appear either
%%  on the same page or on two pages appearing face-to-face in a two-
%%  side setting, i.e., on successive even and odd pages.
%%  A warning is issued if this is not the case.
%%
%%   This package provides two commands:
%%     - \evenoddcheck{foo} marks the current page as the page where
%%       'foo' appear.
%%     - \evenoddcheck{foo} again (or \evenoddendcheck) checks that
%%       the current page is either the same as where 'foo' appeared,
%%       or is the next page and is odd.
